# animated_scatter_plot

![](plots/FertilityVsLifeExpectancy.gif)

The code in this repository was mainly written to show how to create an animatted scatterplot. It also shows hot to create hierarchichal indexes, and convert the multiple series's dataframes
into one integrated data set (data frame). It uses the benefits from pandas for engineering the data, matplotlip for plotting and imageio for generating a gif made of many multiple individual images. 

Examples of the images it creates are located within the "plots folder". 

The data files corresp[ond to the life expectancy and fertility from world wide populations (Gapminder data).
